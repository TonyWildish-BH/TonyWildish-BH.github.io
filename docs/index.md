# Placeholder documentation

## Overview

Our documentation is spread across the three main functions within the Barts Health Data Platform (BHDP). These are:
- The [Data Portal](portal/Home.html) for making Data Access Requests and managing your project once approved.
- The [Analytics Data Core](adc/Homne.html) which transforms the data that you will be authorised access to.
- Our [Secure Data Environment](sde/Home.html) based in Azure where you will be able to analyse the data we provide.

If you have issues with any of these services or documentation then please contact someone...
